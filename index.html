  </section>
  <section id="about"><h2>About Me</h2>
    <li>I have been a lifelong resident of San Diego County, California, USA — specifically, I have resided in Poway most of my life, but I was born in Escondido and raised there prior to my teenage years.</li>
    <li>I am the oldest of four children — I have a sister, as well as two brothers who are fraternal twins, and we all attended different universities.</li>
        <li>The first time I ever went on a computer was before I learned how to read, and the first operating system I used was MS-DOS to load old computer games with CGA-based graphics (which had only four colors).</li>
    <li>I began working part-time during my senior year in high school, and then held two part-time jobs while attending college: one while at community college, and later, a different job throughout my university years.</li>
    </section>
    <section id="values"><h2>What I Value</h2><li>When I work, I focus on ensuring that both products and processes contain a high level of quality.</li>
    <li>I also believe in trying (to the extent possible) to get the job done right the first time around.</li>
  <li>However, I also value a positive and collaborative work environment, where everybody respects one another and tries to work together to accomplish common objectives.</li>
  <li>Additionally, if I know that somebody needs assistance, I am glad to provide it (or refer them to a source that I know can help them if I myself am not able or qualified).</li>
